# Frame.io 
Frame.io is a cloud-based collaboration hub that allows video professionals to share files, comment on clips real-time, and compare different versions and edits of a clip. With the addition of our custom actions feature, developers can extend Frame.io's capabilities by adding their own features (referred to as custom actions).

# Use Custom Actions with Frame.io

This is an example application which shows how to create a custom action for Frame.io. Frame.io custom actions allow you to build integrations directly into Frame.io as programmable UI components. This enables a whole class of workflows that can be triggered by users within the app, leveraging the same underlying events routing as Frame.io [webhooks](https://docs.frame.io/docs/webhooks). You can read more about custom actions in the [Custom Actions Overview](https://docs.frame.io/docs/uploading-assets) documentation.

Currently, custom actions are available for assets, and are displayed in the contextual / right-click dropdown menu available on any asset. An Asset is a robust representation of a file in S3, and its context in Frame.io, including transcodes, user/team/project context, and metadata. You can read about Assets in the [Uploading Assets](https://docs.frame.io/docs/uploading-assets) guide. In the Frame.io app, a custom action appears as shown in the image where *Test* is the name of the custom action:

You can create multiple custom actions, and they will all appear in the same area as the Test custom action. 

In this example, we'll present the user with a form asking them to provide their name and favorite color. On submission, we'll present the user with a confirmation message.

For more information about how custom actions work, check out our [documentation](https://docs.frame.io/docs/custom-actions).

## Pre-requisites 

* Developer account with Frame.io - [https://developer.frame.io](https://developer.frame.io/)
* Note that you will need **Team Manager** permissions to create Custom Actions for your team.
* Web server with a publicly accessible address - we recommend trying: 
  * [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) 
  * [ngrok](https://https://ngrok.com/)

NOTE: If you just want to see the sample run, we've set up a version for you here: [Custom Actions with Glitch](https://glitch.com/~frameio-custom-actions) If you choose to use this version, make sure you put the trailing slash in at the end of the address when you set up your custom action at [developer.frame.io](https://developer.frame.io) like so: [https://frameio-custom-action.glitch.me/](https://frameio-custom-action.glitch.me) 

## Configure Your Custom Action

You must configure your custom action in the [Custom Actions](https://developer.frame.io/actions/) area of developer.frame.io. Follow the instructions provided here: [Setup](https://docs.frame.io/docs/custom-actions#section-setup).

NOTE: For Glitch, you must include a trailing slash when adding your URL to the Custom Action area. For ngrok, you'll need to add ```/actions``` to the end of your ngrok address.

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```
$ npm start
```

By default the application runs on port 3000, however this can be overridden by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Troubleshooting

If you need help getting ngrok to work, you can check out our [troubleshooting guide for ngrok](https://docs.frame.io/docs/how-to-setup-and-troubleshoot-ngrok-mac). (It has a few tips for Glitch as well.)
